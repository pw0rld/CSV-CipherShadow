# SEVerEst

For SEVerEst, it is register observation. In the original SEV/CSV, there is no register encryption. In ES/CSV v2 and SNP/v3, registers are encrypted. However, another primitive in the paper can observe register encrypted values. In our patch, we also observe and determine whether vulnerabilities exist.
